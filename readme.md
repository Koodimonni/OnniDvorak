Keyboard layout for my taste. This helps to keep your fingers in the middle row and puts characters useful for coding near your fingertips.

![Onni Dvorak](/onnidvorak-screenshot.png?raw=true "Keyboard layout")

I have been using this keyboard from 2013 and it doesn't make me super fast but it helped cure my disease of looking at the keyboard and it's more ergonomic because my hands don't need to travel that much when coding.

The layout is based on os x DVORAK-QWERTY layout. Modifications were done by [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele)

##Installation
Copy files from layout folder into:
/Library/Keyboard Layouts

Activate from Settings -> Keyboard -> Input

##Additions
You can have more customized shortcuts and keyboard bindings in OS X with
